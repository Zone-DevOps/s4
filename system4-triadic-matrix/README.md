# System 4 Triadic Transformation Matrix

Implementation of the System 4 consciousness architecture with triadic concurrent processing based on A000081 (unlabeled rooted trees).

## Architecture

The system implements 3 concurrent sets processing temporal dimensions:
- **Set 1 (Past/Actual)**: Performance measurement and alignment tracking
- **Set 2 (Present/Real)**: Relevance realization and commitment
- **Set 3 (Future/Virtual)**: Potential projection and exploration

Each set progresses through 4 steps, with 3 complete cycles forming a 12-step transformation.

## Usage

### Initialize a New Scenario

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Initialize New Scenario"
3. Enter scenario name and parameters
4. Run workflow

### Take Next Step

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Take Next Step"
3. Enter scenario name
4. Specify number of steps (1-12)
5. Run workflow

## State Files

- `scenarios/`: Scenario definitions
- `states/`: State snapshots at each step
- `logs/`: Step-by-step transformation logs

## Theory

Based on the principle that consciousness emerges from the interference pattern of three temporal processing streams, creating a self-grounding system similar to 3-phase power generation.

The Arena-Agent-Relevance (AAR) model emerges naturally from this triadic structure rather than being imposed externally.
